\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{SNAP Background}
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is one of the largest government assistance programs.
\begin{itemize}
\item
	2016: 44m recipients, cost of \$70 billion FY2016 \begin{tiny}[\href{https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/pd/SNAPsummary.pdf}{Source: USDA FNS}]
\end{tiny}	
\item 
	Started in 1964%, expanded in 1971, purchase requirement eliminated in 1977
\item 
	Paid for by Feds (the farm bill), administered by states
\item
	Electronic Balance Transfer (EBT) in early 2000s
\item 
	Name changed to SNAP in 2008.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How It Works}
Eligibility:
\begin{itemize}
\item Less than \$2,250/\$3,500 in countable assets. (Not home, sometimes car.)
\item Less than net monthly income 100\% of FPL, Gross 130\% (\$2,021/\$2,628 family of 4)
\item Earned income, dependent care, medical expenses, child support, excess shelter deductions.
\item $ Benefits=MaxBenefits(\$649/month)-NetIncome*0.3 $
\end{itemize}
\begin{tiny}
\href{https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligibility}{[Source:USDA FNS]}
\end{tiny}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Recent Issues}
\begin{itemize}
\item Large increase in recipients after financial crisis.
\item ARRA: Benefits increased \$80/month in 2009, decreased in 2013.
\item Able bodied without dependents 18-49(ABAWDs) eligibility maxes out at 3/36 months. Waived with high unemployment---kicking back in after Great Recession.
\item Food insecurity among recipient households remains quite high \href{http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/1896841/err194.pdf}{(Coleman-Jensen et al., 2014)}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Very Recent Issues}
Administration Proposals:
\begin{itemize}
\item \$193b (25+\%) cut over 10 years
\item Require ABAWDs work if $<$10\% unemployment
\item Eliminate minimum benefit (\$16)
\item Eliminate increase in benefits beyond 6 people in household. 
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Our Research I}
\begin{itemize}
\item
 While legislated maximum SNAP benefits are fixed across 48 states, food prices vary significantly across geographic locations.
\item Deductions for costs of housing, medical care, and dependent care help, but are not sufficient sufficient to equalize real value of SNAP benefits across geographic areas \href{http://www.childrenshealthwatch.org/publication/real-cost-of-a-healthy-diet-2011/}{(Breen et al., 2011)}.
\item Food price variation has been studied using BLS data at the census region level, or using \href{http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/quarterly-food-at-home-price-database.aspx}{QFAHPD} for 35 market groups \href{http://aepp.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/4/679}{(Gregory \& Coleman-Jensen, 2013)}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Our Research II}
\begin{itemize}
\item
 What fraction of recipients can actually afford the TFP locally?
\item 
\textbf{What does SNAP relative generosity do to nutrition?}
\item Other data: 
 What does SNAP relative generosity do to child health?
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}

\begin{frame}{Conclusions and Concerns from Variation in Sufficiency}
 
Bronchetti, Christensen, Hansen
 
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Fraction of SNAP households who can afford to purchase the TFP within their county 75\% to 80\%.

\begin{itemize}
\item Matters less what shopping radius you use than whether people can find and shop at minimum store.

\end{itemize}
\item 
Estimated measures of SNAP adequacy are higher among SNAP-eligible households than SNAP recipients, with results dependent on benefit calculation method.
\item 
Families in high-price and perhaps metro areas are less able to afford the TFP.

\item Gap measure hard to define in useful relative terms (zero/very low income, benefits).

 Bronchetti, Christensen, Hoynes
 
\href{http://www.ukcpr.org/sites/www.ukcpr.org/files/UKCPR\%20Grant\%20Winners\%20Announcement.pdf}{The Real Value of SNAP Benefits and Health Outcomes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use QFAHPD and restricted access geo-located NHIS to look at how food price variation affects health outcomes among SNAP recipients and SNAP eligibles (UKCPR).
\item 
10 percent increase in SNAP purchasing power increases the likelihood a child had a check-up in the past year by 5.4 percent and may reduce the likelihood that children delay or go without care due to cost.
\item
We do not find much evidence that these higher prices cause detrimental impacts on health status, the likelihood of a hospitalization, or other measures of physical (e.g., obesity) and mental health (e.g., child has emotional problems). School days is exception.
